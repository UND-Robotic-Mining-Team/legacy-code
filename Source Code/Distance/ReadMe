This is distance detecting code for the Robotics team.

distanceDetect.cpp is meant to be a .o file that will be incorporated with the main
 code for the robot. It does not contain a main function.

pose.cpp is a test program that has the same functionality as distanceDetect.cpp, but it
 has its own main function.

The only issue with this code is that it needs the OpenCV library and the arUco library(which is included in OpenCV
 if you get the additional files when installing). Currently those libraries are not set up on here correctly. Once 
 they are,  these two programs should work as intended.

config.yml contains the calibration information for the Yilador HD 1080P webcam that was provided by Dr. Neubert.
 This file is essential to correctly measuring distance. If a new/different camera is used, a new config.yml file
 will have to be generated(OpenCV and arUco provide programs to achieve this). 

**may need to create a CmakeList.txt file to compile correctly.
